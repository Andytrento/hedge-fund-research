* The dataset contains hedge funds that follow an "equity hedge" strategy. Data
  description can be found on HFR website and [here](data/data-description.md). There are also macro/financial
  variables added to the DB, which have been taken from OECD and FRED DB based
  on the country of registration of the fund (but 99% are US).

* The most important info is of course RETURNS, which are the fund's return, as
  well as ID (fund identifier), SUB-Strategy (more detailed info on strategies),
  date, ASSETS (in Mio), leverage, etc. [HFR Database Field
